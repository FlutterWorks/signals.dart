## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Fine grained reactivity" icon="pencil">
		Based on Preact Signals and provides a fine grained reactivity system that will automatically track dependencies and free them when no longer needed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="100% Dart Native" icon="forward-slash">
		Supports Dart JS (HTML), Shelf Server, CLI (and Native), VM, Flutter (Web, Mobile and Desktop). Signals can be used in any Dart project!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Lazy evaluation" icon="approve-check">
		Signals are lazy and will only compute values when read. If a signal is not read, it will not be computed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Flexible API" icon="puzzle">
		Every app is different and signals can be composed in multiple ways. There are a few rules to follow but the API surface is small.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Surgical Rendering" icon="star">
		Widgets can be rebuilt surgically, only marking dirty the parts of the Widget tree that need to be updated and if mounted.
	</Card>
